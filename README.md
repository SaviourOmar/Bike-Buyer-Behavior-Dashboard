# üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bike Buyer Data Analysis - Excel Project

## Project Overview

This repository houses an in-depth data analysis project conducted entirely within Microsoft Excel, focusing on understanding the factors that influence bike purchasing decisions. By analyzing a rich dataset of potential bike buyers, this project aims to uncover patterns, segment customers, and provide actionable insights for businesses in the cycling industry.

## Files in This Repository

* `Excel Project.xlsx - bike_buyers.csv`:
    This is the primary dataset containing raw customer demographic and purchasing information.
    **Key Columns**:
    * `ID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
    * `Marital Status`: Marital status of the customer (e.g., Married, Single).
    * `Gender`: Gender of the customer (Female/Male).
    * `Income`: Annual income of the customer.
    * `Children`: Number of children the customer has.
    * `Education`: Highest education level achieved.
    * `Occupation`: Customer's occupation.
    * `Home Owner`: Indicates if the customer owns a home (Yes/No).
    * `Cars`: Number of cars owned by the customer.
    * `Commute Distance`: Distance of daily commute.
    * `Region`: Geographic region of the customer.
    * `Age`: Age of the customer.
    * `Purchased Bike`: Indicates if the customer purchased a bike (Yes/No).

* `Excel Project.xlsx - WORKING SHEET.csv`:
    This file is a working version of the `bike_buyers.csv` dataset, potentially including additional calculated fields or data cleaning steps.
    **Notable Addition**:
    * `Age brackets`: Categorization of age into predefined brackets (e.g., Adoescents, Middle Age, Old) for easier analysis.

* `Excel Project.xlsx - PIVOT TABLE.csv`:
    Contains the results of pivot table analysis performed on the datasets. This file provides summarized data, notably showing the average income based on gender and whether a bike was purchased. It's a key output for deriving insights.

* `Excel Project.xlsx - DASHBOARD.csv`:
    (Currently empty) This file is designated for the project's dashboard, which would visually present key metrics, trends, and findings from the analysis in an interactive and easy-to-understand format. It serves as a placeholder for future visualization development.

## Analysis and Insights

This project demonstrates the ability to:

* **Perform Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Although not explicitly shown in separate files, the existence of a "WORKING SHEET" implies these steps.
* **Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: By examining demographic distributions and their relationship with bike purchases.
* **Utilize Pivot Tables for Aggregation**: Summarizing complex data into digestible formats to identify trends (e.g., average income per buyer segment).
* **Identify Key Customer Demographics**: Pinpointing which segments are more likely to purchase bikes.
* **Derive Actionable Business Insights**: Informing targeted marketing campaigns, product development, and sales strategies.

## How to Use This Project

To explore this project:

1.  Download the CSV files to your local machine.
2.  Open the CSV files in Microsoft Excel or any compatible spreadsheet software.
3.  Examine the `WORKING SHEET.csv` for the prepared data.
4.  Review `PIVOT TABLE.csv` to see the aggregated results and insights.
5.  (Optional) Create your own dashboard in `DASHBOARD.csv` using the data from the other sheets to visualize the findings.

## Future Enhancements

* Populate the `DASHBOARD.csv` with interactive charts and graphs.
* Conduct more advanced statistical analysis within Excel or by importing the data into a programming language like Python or R.
* Integrate additional datasets (e.g., regional economic data, competitor sales) for a more holistic view.
